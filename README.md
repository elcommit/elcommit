## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a freelance full stack web developer that specializes in Squarspace. I really enjoy to make responsive, mobile-friendly websites. I work with front-end (what you see) and also back-end (how everything works), so I can build the full solution from start to finish.

Usually I work with technologies like React, Node.js, Vue.js, and Python to make websites that look good and run smooth. I like to listen my clients carefully to understand exactly what they want and always try my best to deliver even better. My style is modern and clean.

When Iâ€™m not working, I like walking around Buenos Aires, drinking mate, or going to local dev/crypto meetups to learn new things.

Feel free to contact meâ€”we can build something great together! I have profiles on Upwork and Fiverr.
